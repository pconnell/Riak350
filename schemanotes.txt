bucket: posts
-------------
[
  hash(title)_yyyymmdd => [
    title => ""
    body => ""
    date => yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
    comments => [
      hash(title)_yyyymmdd => [
        title => ""
        body => ""
        author => ""
        date => yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
      ]
    ]
  ]
]

Use links for tags, so:
  tag => /posts/key


* Retrieving a post gets you both the post and its comments
* To add a post, just build out the structure above with an empty comments array, then save
* To add a comment, retrieve the post, append the comment to the comments array, then save



An alternative model is this:
bucket: posts
-------------
[
  hash(title)_yyyymmdd => [
    title => ""
    body => ""
    date => yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
  ]
]

Each post has two kinds of links..
1: from a post to its comments
  eg "comment" => /comments/commentkey
2: from a post to another post (a tag)
  eg "thetag" => /posts/postkey


bucket: comments
----------------
[
    hash(title)_yyyymmdd => [
        title => ""
        body => ""
        author => ""
        date => yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
      ]
    ]
]
